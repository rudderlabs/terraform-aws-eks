# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service Provisioner
These Terraform scripts provision an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS EKS) cluster in a new VPC and restrict access to other cloud resources owned by you.

# Key features

* Separate VPC

* Separate Kubernetes cluser

## Input parameters
1. Region: AWS region to create the VPC.

Please go through `variables.tf` for other config variables.

## How do you run?

1. Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) v0.12.0 or later.
1. Open `variables.tf` and checkout the default values for the variables. You can change them if you wish. For example, to change your nodes configuration alter the default values for variables `rudder_node_type` and `rudder_disk_size_gb`.
1. Run `terraform get`.
1. Run `terraform plan`.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply`. This will create all the needed resources on your AWS.
1. If you would like to use `kubectl`, run ``export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/kubeconfig_rudder-cluster``

The kubernetes cluster created by these terraform scripts is by default accessible by rudder. (You can revoke access by following the instructions given at the end.)

## Access for Managed Hosting
For managed hosting, Rudder would need to access your AWS cluster. Please share the following to enable Rudder managed hosting
1. `rudder_kubeconfig_rudder-cluster`
1. `aws.yml`

## Remove Access To Rudder
To revoke Rudder's access to your kubernetes cluster, follow the following steps
1. Remove default values for the variables `map_accounts` and `map_roles` in `variables.tf` file.
1. `terraform apply`
